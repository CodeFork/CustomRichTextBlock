# CustomRichTextBlock

Custom RichTextBlock control for Universal Windows Platform that is able to
translate specific plain text into emoji image, hyperlink button, etc.


 ## Feature
 1. Only need to input the plain text in the property of Text.
 2. Text property bindable.





 ## Know Issue
 1. Input with plain text directly will cause xaml reader throws exception. The only workaround here is using binding on the control, just like how I do on the project.
